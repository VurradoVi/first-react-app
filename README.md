# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# How to start a project

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Then execute the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VurradoVi/first-react-app.git
```

This command creates a local copy of your project on your disk.

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

After cloning, navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:

```bash
cd first-react-app
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Before running the project, you need to install all dependencies. Execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

This command reads the `package.json` file in your project directory and installs all listed dependencies.

### Step 4: Run the Project

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the project using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts the Vite development server. By default, your project will be available at `http://localhost:5173/`. Open this URL in your web browser to see your React application running.

Make sure you have Git and Node.js installed on your computer before starting. If you don't have them, download and install them from the official websites [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
